The second set focused on the button's function, presenting the choices of initiating a new trade with a randomized pairing system or opening a secret page with special deals. Additionally, the user was offered a checklist of features to consider implementing alongside the button, which included adding detailed tooltips, a confirmation dialog, button customization, animation for engagement, a user feedback form, and a shortcut key guide; some of which have been marked as complete, such as customizing and animating the button.
