The user then requested a form to email Santa, to which the AI again confirmed, stating it would work on it (AI: \"Sure, I will work on adding the email Santa form\"). \n\nIn response to adding the email feature, the user was provided options regarding the form fields and design preferences. The AI documented the user\u2019s choices and reiterated its commitment to the new feature. \n\nFurther, the user asked to add a \"Shoryouken\" button, which the AI acknowledged and began to address. The user repeatedly requested descriptions on button placement and functionality, resulting in specific follow-up questions from the AI.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the AI consistently acknowledged the user\u2019s requests and provided options to enhance user experience, focusing on the dinosaur theme and additional functionalities like the email form to Santa and the Shoryouken feature.",
